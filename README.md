# Driver Drowsiness Introduction 

An Exclusive, EEG based Driver Drowsiness Detection system submitted as a Final Year Project to Bahria University.

## Getting Started

To get started developing right away:

1. Clone the application:
`$ https://github.com/yahyawasim97/driver-drowsiness-backend`

2. Start the application:
`node index.js`

## Functionality

This project is used to detect driver drowsiness by analyzing EEG(electroencephalogram) signals of the driver. It is based on MERN stack and uses the principals of Artificial Intelligence to produce more accurate results. The quality of this system is that is not affected by Environmental Factors

## Key Features

1. Single Sensor Base

Uses the AF3 sensor which allows this project to move its span for the 14 channel EEG device to a single Ear-based or Glasses-Based EEG device.

2. Accurate

Among every other framework (Computer Vision, etc.) EEG is considered as the safest idea or approach to determine the sleepiness of drivers which is not affected by external factors, resulting in more accurate results.

3. Absolutely Free

This project is based on open-source framework and technologies, easing with the flexibility to use the project or you can even contribute to enchance the performance and accuracy.

## Contributing
The main purpose of this repository is to provide some contribution in Brain Computing.
